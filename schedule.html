    <h1>Please use #super-guidebookupdates</h1>
    <div>
        <p>The Uber Schedule has already been exported for this year, and further updates should be requested in slack.</p>
        <h3>Please bear the following in mind:</h3>
        <p>Every request should include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The name of the panel, guest, or item exactly as it should appear in Guidebook</li>
          <li>Start time in 12-hour Eastern Timezone</li>
          <li>End time in 12-hour Eastern Timezone</li>
          <li>Calendar date of the event (not just the weekday)</li>
          <li>Gaylord room name</li>
          <li>Track(s), if applicable</li>
          <li>Guest/Artist linkage, if applicable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please do not include extraneous copypasta text (i.e. Description: XXXXX) as we are copy-pasting exactly what you give us. We are not proof-reading or editing to remove this stuff.</p>
        <p>Please do not include stories about why things are changes, etc. Requests should be concise, and literal.</p>
